To complete this project outside of the classroom time, we would communicate over Slack. Slack is a workspace chat channel specified for the Computer Science industry. Occasionally through text as well. We met after class three times to go over code we did not understand in the last two weeks of having the assignment. Overall, it was well planned teamwork and it resulted in working code, intended design, and functioning output.
